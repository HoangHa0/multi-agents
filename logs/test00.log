Option A: Chikungunya
Support:
- "pain in his hands and wrists": Severe joint pain is hallmark of chikungunya, often affecting hands and wrists.
- "maculopapular rash on his trunk and upper thighs": Classic rash presentation for chikungunya.
- "recently returned from Vietnam and Cambodia": Both are endemic for chikungunya.

Refute:
- "Leukocyte count: 3,200/mm^3, Platelet count: 112,000/mm^3": While possible, these are more characteristic of dengue.
- "Tourniquet test is negative": While not definitive, positive test is more associated with dengue.

Option B: Dengue fever
Support:
- "fever, malaise, headache": Common symptoms of dengue.
- "maculopapular rash": Rash is common in dengue as well.
- "recently returned from Vietnam and Cambodia": Both are highly endemic for dengue.

Refute:
- "pain in his hands and wrists": Dengue typically causes myalgia and arthralgia, not necessarily localized joint pain.
- "Tourniquet test is negative": A positive test would strongly favor dengue, but it's negative here.

Option C: Epstein-Barr virus
Support:
- "fatigue, malaise": Common symptoms of EBV (mononucleosis).
- "AST: 106 U/L, ALT: 112 U/L": Mild transaminitis can occur in EBV.

Refute:
- "maculopapular rash": Rash is uncommon in EBV without amoxicillin exposure.
- "pain in his hands and wrists": Not typical for EBV; usually presents with sore throat and lymphadenopathy.

Option D: Hepatitis A
Support:
- "AST: 106 U/L, ALT: 112 U/L": Classic elevation for hepatitis.
- "fatigue, malaise": Common symptoms of hepatitis.

Refute:
- "pain in his hands and wrists": Unusual for hepatitis A; more likely to have RUQ pain.
- "maculopapular rash": Rash is not a typical feature of hepatitis A.

Option E: Typhoid fever
Support:
- "fever": Classic symptom of typhoid.
- "recently returned from Vietnam and Cambodia": Both are endemic for typhoid.

Refute:
- "maculopapular rash": While typhoid can present with rose spots, maculopapular rash is not typical.
- "pain in his hands and wrists": Joint pain is not a typical feature of typhoid; more likely to present with abdominal symptoms.

Probabilities:
A: 0.35  B: 0.27  C: 0.10  D: 0.08  E: 0.20

Uncertainty / what would disambiguate:
- "Serum IgM for dengue and chikungunya" to confirm which arbovirus is present.
- "Blood culture" to rule out typhoid fever.
